# Supabase Schema Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've created an optimized, storage-efficient database schema for the job automation system, specifically designed for Supabase's free tier (500MB limit). This implementation focuses on:

1. Minimizing storage usage through compression and efficient data structures
2. Supporting 5,000-7,000 active job listings
3. Enabling efficient queries for common operations
4. Tracking Canadian PR-relevant job data
5. Implementing automated maintenance and archiving

## Implementation Components

### 1. SQL Schema Files

- **`schema.sql`**: Complete database schema with tables, functions, indexes, and policies
- **`manual-apply-schema.sql`**: Version ready for direct application in Supabase SQL editor, including sample data

### 2. Deployment Scripts

- **`apply-schema.js`**: Node.js script to apply schema to Supabase
- **`check-storage.js`**: Tool for monitoring storage usage and forecasting capacity
- **`test-queries.js`**: Script to validate query performance and schema efficiency

### 3. Documentation

- **`README.md`**: Main documentation on schema design and usage
- **`update-n8n-supabase.md`**: Guide for integrating with n8n workflows
- **`schema-implementation-summary.md`**: This summary file

## Key Features

### Storage Optimization

- **Text Compression**: Job descriptions are compressed using PostgreSQL's built-in compression
- **JSONB for Flexibility**: Use of JSONB fields for flexible data without fixed schema constraints
- **Efficient Indexing**: Targeted indexes for common query patterns
- **Automated Archiving**: Jobs older than 30 days are automatically archived

### Performance Considerations

- **Batch Operations**: All scripts and examples use batched operations
- **Selective Querying**: Patterns for querying only needed fields
- **Optimized Functions**: Helper functions like `insert_job_with_compression` and `get_job_with_description`

### Canadian PR Tracking

- **NOC Codes**: Specific fields for tracking NOC codes (National Occupational Classification)
- **PR Eligibility**: Boolean flag for jobs eligible for permanent residency
- **Location Focus**: Indexing on location for Canadian job searches

## Storage Efficiency Metrics

Based on the schema design and compression functions:

- **Average Job Size**: ~5KB per job (with compression)
- **Company Data**: ~10KB per company
- **Application Data**: ~1KB per application
- **Estimated Capacity**: ~7,000 active jobs within 500MB limit

## Maintenance and Monitoring

- **Daily Maintenance**: Automated function to archive old jobs and update statistics
- **Storage Monitoring**: View to track database and table sizes
- **Usage Forecasting**: Scripts to project when storage limits will be reached
- **Performance Testing**: Query analysis to ensure indexes are effective

## Integration with n8n

The implementation includes guidance for:

1. Updating existing n8n workflows to use the optimized schema
2. Implementing batch processing for job insertions
3. Using compression functions for job descriptions
4. Monitoring storage usage and setting up alerts

## Next Steps

To fully implement the schema:

1. Run the `apply-schema.js` script or execute `manual-apply-schema.sql` in Supabase
2. Modify n8n workflows according to the guide
3. Set up a scheduled task to run the `maintain_database` function daily
4. Regularly run `check-storage.js` to monitor usage
5. Test queries with `test-queries.js` to validate performance
