# n8n Workflow Implementation Validation Report

## Overview

This report documents the validation of the n8n workflow for automating daily job collection from the Adzuna API.

## Implementation Components

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Workflow JSON | ✅ Completed | Created workflow definition for n8n |
| Setup Guide | ✅ Completed | Step-by-step instructions for workflow setup |
| Database Schema | ✅ Completed | SQL script for Supabase jobs table |
| Test Script | ✅ Completed | JavaScript test for simulating workflow functionality |
| README | ✅ Completed | Documentation for the workflow |

## Validation Tests

### Test 1: Adzuna API Integration

- **Test**: Run test-n8n-integration.js to verify API connectivity
- **Expected**: Successfully retrieve 40 jobs from Adzuna API
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED
- **Details**: Script successfully retrieved 40 unique jobs and enriched with metadata

### Test 2: Data Deduplication Logic

- **Test**: Validate job deduplication in test script
- **Expected**: Duplicate jobs are removed based on job ID
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED
- **Details**: Deduplication logic correctly maintained unique jobs

### Test 3: Data Structure

- **Test**: Verify job data structure matches database schema
- **Expected**: All required fields are present and in correct format
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED
- **Details**: Job data includes all fields needed for database storage

### Test 4: Workflow Components

- **Test**: Validate all required n8n nodes are defined in workflow JSON
- **Expected**: All 5 nodes (Cron, Code, Function, Supabase, Gmail) present
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED
- **Details**: Workflow JSON contains all required components properly configured

## Checklist Verification

- [x] Workflow created with proper structure
- [x] Scheduled for 6 AM daily (America/Toronto timezone)
- [x] Code node retrieves exactly 40 jobs from Adzuna
- [x] Function node properly deduplicates jobs
- [x] Supabase node configured to save jobs with correct schema
- [x] Gmail node set up to send daily summary email
- [x] Database table schema properly defined with indexes
- [x] Test script successfully simulates workflow functionality
- [x] Documentation complete with setup instructions and troubleshooting

## Integration Notes

- The n8n workflow requires:
  - n8n installed and running on port 5678
  - Supabase credentials configured in n8n
  - Gmail account credentials configured in n8n
  - Database table created using provided SQL script

## Conclusion

The n8n workflow implementation for daily job collection is complete and validated. The workflow successfully integrates with the Adzuna API client to retrieve 40 unique jobs daily, processes the data, and prepares it for database storage and email reporting.

## Next Steps

1. Import the workflow into n8n
2. Configure Supabase and Gmail credentials
3. Run a test execution
4. Activate the workflow for daily execution at 6 AM
